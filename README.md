# TheMitchWorksPro.github.io
Github Pages Repo

# Understanding github.io Publishing
Pages created directly to this repo are accessed as indicated here:
 - https://themitchworkspro.github.io/  (for index.html)
 - https://themitchworkspro.github.io/PageOnSite.html (replace PageOnSite with actual page)
 
Pages created on other repos that are then set up with the Github Pages settings, publish to subfolders named for each repo.  For example:
- https://themitchworkspro.github.io/devHelp/ (devHelp Repo)
- https://themitchworkspro.github.io/devHelp/LinksForDevelopers1.html (html page on this repo)
- https://themitchworkspro.github.io/devHelp/helloworld.html (md page on this repo)

# Creating Github Pages Repos
1. Create a repo like this one.  To do this
  - Simply create a repo named \<github user name>.github.io
  
2. Pages built on this repo will automatically work as described above
3. To create other repos that publish as described above:
  - create another repo
  - in settings, enable Github pages for them (there is a github pages section under site settings)
  - if you want a theme you can choose one there too
